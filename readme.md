Extended / External Plugin for TF2
----------------------------------

by CasualX

As Valve shown clearly they do not like us bypassing their stupid plugin checks (whose only purpose server to stop modding) an alternative needed to be made. While a straight up plugin would be far more convenient (for both user & developer) it isn't the only option available. The reason this wasn't done earlier this way is because this is much harder and more limited, but I'll see what I can do.

Consider this extremely early alpha version, for now only 1 feature is available:
* Allow mat_picmip in range [-10,6] (from default [-1,2])
